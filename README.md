# The Rust Starter Pack

This is a document containing links and information for people learning the Rust programming language.

Disclaimer: I originally created this document to organize my own Rust learning, and I've since shared it hoping it will help others learning Rust. I've done my best to vet the resources and weed out those that are low quality, but I haven't read every single resource front-to-back. [Caveat emptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor).
